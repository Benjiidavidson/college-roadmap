To get this and run it on your computer:
Open your command prompt
Make or choose a folder to put the project files in
Navigate to that folder in your command prompt. Example: cd C:\Users\jane\College Roadmap Project
Do: git clone https://github.com/grantnaomi/college-roadmap.git
The above command should clone the repository into the folder you wanted
To run it for the first time, navigate to that folder (if you left it)
Then do: npm install node
Then do: npm install
Now do: node app.js
Then, on your browser, go to the URL: localhost:8080
It should have some text on the page.
